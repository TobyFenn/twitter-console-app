# TwitEng: C++ Twitter Simulation Engine

## Overview
**TwitEng** is a C++ implementation that simulates core functionalities of Twitter, highlighting proficiency in various aspects of advanced C++ programming.

## Key Features
### Command Handling:
- Utilizes the Chain of Responsibility design pattern.
- Efficient delegation of command processing using classes such as `QuitHandler`, `AndHandler`, and more.

### Search Capabilities:
- Provides the ability to execute tweet searches employing AND/OR operations for complex query handling.

### Memory Management:
- Implements dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C++, optimizing resource usage.

## Architectural Details
The design of TwitEng is grounded in modular object-oriented programming principles. The project structure comprises classes that encapsulate the fundamental operations of tweets, users, handlers, and the core engine. Some design specifics include:
- Overloading of operators to facilitate object interactions.
- Effective use of stream manipulations for string parsing and processing.
- Incorporation of error checks to enhance system robustness.

## File Operations
TwitEng is equipped with file input/output functionalities, designed for storing and retrieving tweet feeds. The systematic storage allows users to retrieve personalized tweet feeds from distinct files.

## Contributions
Though the primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate advanced programming capabilities, constructive feedback and contributions to enhance the functionality or rectify issues are appreciated.
