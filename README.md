# TwitEng: A Mini Twitter Engine
Welcome to TwitEng, a sophisticated yet minimalistic Twitter-like engine built to showcase advanced C++ programming techniques.

## Features
### Command Handling with Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
The engine's command handling efficiently leverages the Chain of Responsibility design pattern, ensuring scalable and maintainable code. Classes like QuitHandler, AndHandler, and more, each handle specific user commands.

### Advanced Search Functionality:
Users can perform advanced tweet searches using AND/OR logic, allowing for intricate query capabilities.
### Dynamic Memory Management:
The code reflects a keen understanding of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in C++, ensuring efficient memory usage.

## Design & Structure
Diving into the project's architecture, you'll find object-oriented programming at its finest. With classes encapsulating the core functionalities of users, tweets, handlers, and the engine itself, the project is modular and extensible.

Notable design decisions include:
### Overloaded operators for easy interactions.
### Stream manipulations for fluid string handling.
### Thorough error checks for robustness.

## File Handling & I/O
The engine boasts file input/output operations, enabling real-time tweet feeds and data storage. Users can view personalized feeds, stored in individual files, generated with impeccable formatting.

## Contributing & Feedback
While this project primarily serves as a demonstration of programming prowess, contributions and feedback are welcome! Delve in, explore, run the engine, and feel free to suggest enhancements or report issues. Your insights are invaluable.
